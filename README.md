# flipping-out

##Goal
Simulate flipping a coin and showing this data on matplotlib 
in multiple ways


##Notes
Coin-Flips & Coin-Flips Dice Method, CFDM, are two implementations of the 
coin flip simulation.

Coin-Flip uses stacks and, being honest, implementing that took 
a lot longer than implementing CFDM. 

Just now getting around to mapping the data and it's late.


##Requirements
Please look at the requirements.txt to make sure that you have everything that is needed to run the Jupyter notebooks.
